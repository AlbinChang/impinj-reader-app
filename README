This is the official WISP (Wireless Identification and Sensing Platform) demo application.

The WISP community supports Impinj Speedway readers with an LLRP-compatible, C#, Visual Studio GUI application ("WISPDemo"). It has been tested in Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7. This app interacts with WISPs and displays WISP sensor data.
